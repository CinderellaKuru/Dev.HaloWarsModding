# Welcome to the Halo Wars Modding wiki!

{: .important }
THIS WIKI IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS. IF SOMETHING YOU WANT TO MODIFY IS NOT YET DOCUMENTED, THEN IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO JOIN THE MODDING DISCORD TO ASK FOR ASSISTANCE

This is the home for all documentation on modding Halo Wars: Definitive Edition.
These docs will cover everything from the basics like modifying a unit, to rigging and importing new models and beyond.

If you are not already a part of the community, we recommend joining the [Halo Wars Modding Discord](https://discord.gg/GuvUCgqz8d)

### What's Possible?

Currently, the main things we are able to create and edit are:
* Objects (single units, props, buildings)
* Squads (groups of single units)
* Leaders (both playable leaders, and in-game leader units)
* Techs (unit and power upgrades)
* Misc game settings (camera, team colors)

Some things that can only be modified to a limited degree are:
* Maps
  * Objects and squads can be placed on existing maps
  * Skyboxes and terrain textures can be edited
* Scripts
  * Used to create new missions/gamemodes/leader-powers (more research is required still)
* GUI/HUD
  * Can be edited with the right tools (more research is required still)

### New Modders
If you are a first time modder, or are still getting the hang of things, we recommend the [Getting Started Page](/guides/000getting_started). Here you will find everything you need to begin making mods.
