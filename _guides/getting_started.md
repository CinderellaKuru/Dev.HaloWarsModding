If you are a beginner, we recommend reading this page top to bottom twice before moving on to anything else, but if you're here for something specific, you can jump to the desired section by clicking on one of the following:

The absolute backbone of Halo Wars modding is the PHXTool by kornman00. This tool lets you unpack Halo Wars' resource archives, so that you can make use of them in new content, or edit them for existing content. This tool also allows you to easily edit your modmanifest.txt, which determines what directories to load mods from at start-up. More info about modmanifest can be found [[HERE - NEED LINK TO MOD MANIFEST ARTICLE]].
