## What are Tactics Files??

Tactics files are an absolutely essential part of any unit. They enable units to attack, use abilities, gather resources, and more. 

Each unit has its own .tactics file, each of which is referenced in that unit's objects.xml entry. Every tactics is found in the "tactics" folder: 
  (data/tactics/example_01.tactics)
