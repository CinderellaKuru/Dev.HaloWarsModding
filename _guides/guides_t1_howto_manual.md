## Installing Mods Manually

*If you are updating from a previous version, delete the previous version before installing.

Downloading a mod will provide you with an archive, usually .rar or .zip. Extract it with WinRAR, 7zip, or an equivalent program.

  -If you are using the Steam version, you may place the "LeaderOverhaulMod v1.6" folder anywhere on your PC. 

  -If you have the windows store version, then you must put it here:

    C:\Users\*YourUsername*\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.BulldogThreshold_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState

Open the "LeaderOverhaulMod v1.6" folder, then open "ModData" and copy the address/path. 
  
  -If no ModData folder is present, copy the address/path of the mod folder itself instead.

Then, go to:

C:\Users\*YourUsername*\AppData\Local\Halo Wars

Right click, create a .txt file and name it "ModManifest".

Open ModManifest and paste in the address that was copied.

Save ModManifest, and you're done

Example of the mod folder path:

C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\HaloWarsDE\Medstar's HaloWarsDE Mod Manager\HWDE Mods\LeaderOverhaulMod v1.6\ModData
